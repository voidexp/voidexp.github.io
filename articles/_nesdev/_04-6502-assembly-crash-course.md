title: 6502 assembly crash course
---
**DISCLAIMER:** _You're supposed to know some high-level programming before
diving into assembly. Starting to program with assembly as first language,
especially the 6502 one, may do permanent damage to your brain and will to do
programming for the rest of your life. Learn Python or JavaScript at least, some
solid C at best. We're going to craft fun by transforming raw bytes and bits
with nothing more at hand than loops, conditional jumps, very basic arithmetic
and few kilobytes of available memory._

Assembly. The machine code. The raw power to bend the silicon chip and the
hardware at your will.
