title: Shoot'em Up! - the game
---
Before even opening the code editor and writing the first lines of assembly,
we're going to put away the keyboard for a moment and grab the three most
important tools in gamedev: _pencil, paper and imagination_. Writing a solid
concept is probably the most important step when starting a game project and it
definitely deserves an article on its own, which stresses the most fundamental
questions the concept has to answer clearly.

What game are we going to create? A platformer, like Mario? Or an RPG, like The
Legend of Zelda? Maybe a racing game? A puzzle! Or a flight simulator? Why not a
mix of genres? What is the challenge that the player has to overcome? And what
is the reward? What are the skills being stressed? And which emotions we want to
invoke? Does her or she play alone, in co-op with a friend, or competes against
one? How the game does look and feel? Today's gamers have a myriad of choices
for all tastes to pick from and modern hardware has enough processing power to
render immersive procedurally generated and realistically looking 3D worlds, in
which dozens, if not hundreds of hours worth of gameplay may take place. The
only practical limits in designing a game nowadays are mostly dictated by the
team's capacity and budget, which are usually counted in hundreds of people and
millions of dollars for a "typical" Triple-A game.

Back in the '80s though, the first and the hardest limit for a game designer's
imagination was the hardware.

## Hardware constraints and game genres
The design of the game we're going to make has inevitably to take into account
the (quite limited) possibilities of the NES hardware, thus, before even
drafting the concept and detailing the gameplay mechanics, let's start by
examining what the hardware is offering us and see how famous NES games
leveraged it:

#### Graphics
Screenshots of games with explanations

#### Sound
Screenshots of trackers, audio sample

#### Memory
RAM and ROM, examples

#### Periphery
Gamepads, "zapper"

## A top-down scrolling shooter
With these hardware constraints in mind and just because of personal taste, I
decided to make yet another top-down space shooter, boringly named _"Shoot'em
Up!"_, in which the players have to fight their way on spaceships through dead
space infested by unfriendly foes and full of hazards such as asteroids and
toxic gas clouds.

Despite the intended lack of originality, the game will be far from being
simple. My goal is to create a complete game, playable in solo and by two
players, featuring few levels, a variety of enemies and hazards, bosses,
power-ups, animations, sounds and music.

### core loop
what the player will be doing most of the time

### enemies
who's the player is going to fight

### weapons
blasters, lasers, guided and unguided missiles

### power ups
hull repairs, energy shields, EMP charges

### levels and bosses
ambiance, the obstacles and geometry of the level, the bosses that are to be encountered at the end
